# Changelog

All notable changes to the Event Horizon VS Code extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.3] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Grazing Shot** achievement (tiered): astronaut flies dangerously close to the black hole without entering the gravity well
- **Conqueror** achievements: one medal per agent type when an astronaut lands on that planet (Claude Code, OpenCode, Copilot, Unknown)
- **Star Catcher** achievement (tiered): click on a shooting star as it streaks across the sky
- GitHub community health files: issue templates (bug report, feature request), PR template, Dependabot config, FUNDING.yml, `.gitattributes` for LF normalization

### Fixed
- Shooting star burst on resume: all scheduled shooting stars fired simultaneously after the panel was hidden for a while. Now caps tick delta and flushes stale stars on resume
- Removed sourcemap reference from production webview build to eliminate CSP console warning
- Workspace folder cooperation check now uses path boundary (`/project` no longer matches `/project-other`)
- Cooperation ship emitter no longer crashes if webview is disposed between async callbacks
- OpenCode connector no longer mutates the caller's input payload object
- Achievements now persist correctly when the panel is moved (e.g., sidebar to bottom panel). Hydration messages are deferred until the webview signals readiness

## [0.0.2] — 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Extension failed to activate** from marketplace install: workspace packages (`@event-horizon/core`, `connectors`) were not bundled into the VSIX. Extension host is now bundled with esbuild so all dependencies are inlined
- README now appears on the marketplace listing page
- LICENSE included in VSIX package
- Source maps excluded from VSIX, reducing package size from 2.4MB to ~1MB
- Stale artifacts (`%localappdata%/`, `vitest.config.*`) excluded from VSIX

## [0.0.1] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- Live universe visualization: AI coding agents appear as planets with type-specific styles (gas giant, rocky, icy, volcanic)
- Central black hole with gravitational pull on astronauts
- Data transfers rendered as ships flying curved bezier arcs between planets
- Astronauts spawned on click, affected by black hole gravity
- Subagents shown as orbiting moons with stable animation
- Command Center panel with agent identity, live metrics, event logs, and medals tabs
- StarCraft-inspired control grid with hover tooltips
- Connect wizard: one-click Claude Code hook installation
- Connect wizard: one-click OpenCode plugin installation
- 20 achievements with tiered medals and toast notifications (persisted across sessions)
- Demo simulation mode
- Camera pan/zoom with Center button
- Agent state transitions (idle, thinking, tool_use, working, error)
- Stale-agent cleanup for agents that exit without sending termination events
- UFO fly-bys with cow abductions and singularity capture
- Shooting stars, colored background stars, astronaut jetpack
- Workspace-aware agent cooperation (auto-detect agents in same workspace)
- HTTP event server on localhost:28765 with auth token, rate limiting, payload validation
- CI/CD: 3-tier release pipeline (dev → pre-release → stable) with auto-publish to VS Code Marketplace
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy
- 100 unit tests across core, connectors, UI store, and event server
